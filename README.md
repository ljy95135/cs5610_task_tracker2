# Design
In this task, I find to build a stable project with all features implemented is a extremely hard thing. I, in fact, have to make many choices to finish all requirements, so I will try to make all things clear in choice part so that everyone using this project or see my website will not be obstructed. 

## Feature
In this app, you can:
  * Have all features in task1. Except something limit like 15 minutes are removed.
  ** like register with name and email and login with email, both of them are unique in database column

## Choice

# TaskTracker2

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
